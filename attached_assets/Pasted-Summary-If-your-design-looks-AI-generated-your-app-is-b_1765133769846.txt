Summary

If your design looks AI-generated, your app is buggy, or your marketing isn’t converting — I’ll fix it.

I rebuild broken brands, apps, and campaigns from the ground up, covering design, code, and marketing to make them perform like they should.

Backed by my team at SanganakHQ, I turn “vibe-coded” or half-baked projects into fully functional, conversion-ready systems that deliver real business results.
Most agencies over-design, over-code, or over-market — and underperform.
I do the opposite: audit what’s broken, rebuild what matters, and optimize every layer of your brand’s system.

From UX/UI design, frontend/backend dev, SEO & ads, copywriting, and CRO, my team handles everything — with me reviewing every step personally to ensure premium output.
Pricing varies by scope — from small design/code fixes (starting at $1,500) to full brand rebuilds ($10K+)
FAQs

Q: What kind of projects do you take?

Anything that looks good but doesn’t work — AI-generated designs, poorly coded sites/apps, or underperforming marketing campaigns.

Q: Do you work solo or with a team?

I lead every project personally, backed by my team at SanganakHQ for design, development, and growth execution.

Q: Can I hire you for just one part (like design or code)?

Yes, though most clients get the best results when we handle design + dev + marketing together.

Q: How fast will I see results?

Most rebuilds show clear improvements in 2–4 weeks — full growth systems take 6–8 weeks depending on scope.
